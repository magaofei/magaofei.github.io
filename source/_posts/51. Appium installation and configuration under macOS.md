### iOS

System requirements and instructions:

- macOS 10.11 or higher
- `brew`need the latest version of `Xcode` or `Xcode Command Line`

#### Introduction

iOS 9.3 and below use Automation as the underlying technology, XCUITest appears in iOS 9.3, and Automation is abandoned in iOS 10, so Appium is configured differently in iOS 9.3 and below than iOS 10.

### Appium Installation

If you have installed partial dependencies, you can skip it directly

#### Homebrew Installation

It is highly recommended that all software on macOS be installed using Homebrew. Using the software installed by brew, the sudo command is no longer needed.

Open terminal, copy and run：

```
/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
```

The use of brew is very simple, install a software to use

```
brew install #<package name>
```

If the brew prompts that the Xcode version is too low, you need to install a new version of Xcode (you can save both versions when you install)

#### Nodejs Installation

```
brew install node@8
```

Check if the installation is successful

```
node -v
# v6.9.1
npm -v
# 3.10.8
```

#### Appium Installation

Node.js usage

Appium is essentially a Nodejs application, we can use npm to install it, after the installation is complete, you can use the command line to start

```
npm install -g appium
```

You can use appium-doctor to confirm that the installation environment is complete.

```
npm install -g appium-doctor
appium-doctor
```

Download App
The software is relatively simple, has a graphical interface, and has an Inspector tool to help detect interface elements.

### Appium Settings

#### Carthage Installation

Carthage is a package manager that manages iOS development library dependencies

```
brew install carthage
```

#### Install the client language

Which language to use to install which language

#### python

Install Python 3 (skip with Python 2)

```
brew install python3
```

Check successful installation

```
python3 -V
# Python 3.6.0
pip3 -V
# pip 9.0.1 from /usr/local/lib/python3.6/site-packages (python 3.6)
```

Success with the corresponding code

macOS comes with Python2 version. By default, python calls are the system’s python2 and pip (recommended to use virtual environment)

In addition, if the system version has been installed before python3 causes the python3 command not found after installation, you can try `brew link --overwrite python3` relink

Install using pip

```
pip3 install Appium-Python-Client
# python3 -> pip3
# python -> pip
```

More information：<https://github.com/appium/python-client>

#### Java

JDK Installation

```
brew tap caskroom/versions
brew cask install java8
```

Use Maven for dependencies

```
<dependency>
  <groupId>io.appium</groupId>
  <artifactId>java-client</artifactId>
  <version>6.1.0</version>
  <scope>test</scope>
</dependency>
```

More information：<https://github.com/appium/java-client>

#### Installation related dependencies

```
idevicesyslog` and port forwarding `iProxy`, `usbmuxd
brew install libimobiledevice --HEAD   #Communicate with iOS phones
brew install ideviceinstaller   # Install app use
```

Need to use on iOS10 or higher`ios-deploy`

```
npm install -g ios-deploy
```

Need for real devices`xcpretty`

```
gem install xcpretty
```

#### First run configuration

No configuration will appear`xcodebuild exited with code '65' and signal 'null'`error

If have Developer account:

AppiumDesktop add xcodeOrgId 和 xcodeSigningId fields



![img](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/0*rsRDh_up1A510vSb.png)

TeamID is found in the Member ship on the left side of <https://developer.apple.com/account/>

Requires `xcodeOrgId` and `xcodeSigningId` written in desired capabilities

```
{
      "xcodeOrgId": "<Team ID>",
      "xcodeSigningId": "iPhone Developer"
 }
```

the free AppleID account

1. Find the location of WebDriverAgent in appium’s error log, open for signature
2. `[XCUITest] Using WDA path: '/usr/local/lib/node_modules/appium/node_modules/.2.23.1@appium-xcuitest-driver/WebDriverAgent'`
3. Change the `BundleID` of `WebDriverAgent`, which is `com.facebook.WebDriverAgentLib`. I suggest changing `facebook` to your name or company name. There is also a pit here. After changing this, I found that there is an error, and in `Build Settings`. Modify it in the `Product Bundle Identifier`.







1. Click Product -> Test in the menu bar above.
   The first run will prompt no permission, open the settings app on the real machine, general -> description file and device management, find your mailbox, select trust, and then continue to execute test, after successful startup, it can be explained, click after execution stop.
2. End, open the Appium test.

#### View interface elements

- use WebDriverAgent

```
Clone from https://github.com/facebook/WebDriverAgent, execute the ./Scripts/bootstrap.sh command, and open the project to sign it.
Implementation modalities
- Then click on Product --> test in the menu bar above.
- xcodebuild -project WebDriverAgent.xcodeproj -scheme WebDriverAgentRunner -destination id='udid' test
# udid can be obtained with the command idevice_id -l
```

use AppiumDesktop

app-inspector usage

```
# macaca-cli
npm install macaca-cli -g
# macaca doctor
macaca doctor
# app-inspector
npm install app-inspector -g
# usage
app-inspector -u 'udid'
```



#### 253 error code

If you run the official TestApp example, you may get a 253 error, then you need to rebuild the test app (requires source code)

xcodebuild command

project

```
xcodebuild [-project projectname] [-target targetname ...] [-configuration configurationname]
            [-sdk [sdkfullpath | sdkname]] [buildaction ...] [setting=value ...]
            [-userdefault=value ...]
```

workspace

```
xcodebuild -workspace workspacename -scheme schemename [-destination destinationspecifier]
            [-destination-timeout value] [-configuration configurationname]
            [-sdk [sdkfullpath | sdkname]] [buildaction ...] [setting=value ...]
            [-userdefault=value ...]
```

For example

```
# xcodebuild -project RobotCalibration.xcodeproj -target RobotCalibration -sdk iphoneos -configuration development
```

#### DesiredCapabilities Configuration information

- determine `**platformVersion**`
- determine `**bundleId**`
- If there is only one device, `udid` can be set to `auto`
- You can also raise the `app` without providing the app attribute, but you need to set the `bundleId`
- When testing iOS 9.3 or lower, you need to set `automationName` to `Automation` and others to `XCUITest`.

#### Common command

Switch Xcode

```
sudo xcode-select -s #path /Applications/Xcode.app/
```

view devices udid

```
idevice_id -l
# Or use ideviceinfo to find udid in the returned data.
```

### Automation （iOS 10 or lower）

Recommended Use:

Xcode7.3.1

note:

In iOS8, you need to make sure UIAutomation in the developer options in the settings is open.

```
Have a developer account — > Open Xcode — > Register for device
Free account ─> open project —> modify bundleID —> login account to sign
```

Check if the set App directory is correct before testing.

Then you can open Appium, and test cases.

If you do not involve automatic installation and uninstallation of the app, you can manually install the app to the target device before testing.

Prerequisites require `ideviceinstaller`

```
ideviceinstaller -u <UDID of device> -i <path of .app/.ipa>
```

Instruments exited with code: 253

[Instruments] Error launching instruments: Instruments crashed on startup

May be the App path is incorrect

#### Authorized iOS Simulator

Need to test the simulator for this, install with npm

```
npm install -g authorize-ios
```

Run after installation

```
sudo authorize-ios
```

Note: you need to execute again after installing the new Xcode

#### Run iOS test with Jenkins (not tested)

Confirm that `authorize-ios` runs successfully before

download Jenkins

```
wget https://jenkins.ci.cloudbees.com/jnlpJars/jenkins-cli.jar
```

Next define a Jenkins LaunchAgent to log in automatically, make sure it doesn’t include `SessionCreate` or `User`key key to prevent the test from running.

```
java -jar jenkins-cli.jar \
 -s https://team-appium.ci.cloudbees.com \
 -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa \
 on-premise-executor \
 -fsroot ~/jenkins \
 -labels osx \
 -name mac_appium
```

Finally set and start

```
sudo nano /Library/LaunchAgents/com.jenkins.ci.plist
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">
<plist version="1.0">
<dict>
    <key>Label</key>
    <string>com.jenkins.ci</string>
    <key>ProgramArguments</key>
    <array>
        <string>java</string>
        <string>-Djava.awt.headless=true</string>
        <string>-jar</string>
        <string>/Users/appium/jenkins/jenkins-cli.jar</string>
        <string>-s</string>
        <string>https://instructure.ci.cloudbees.com</string>
        <string>on-premise-executor</string>
        <string>-fsroot</string>
        <string>/Users/appium/jenkins</string>
        <string>-executors</string>
        <string>1</string>
        <string>-labels</string>
        <string>mac</string>

    </array>
    <key>KeepAlive</key>
    <true/>
    <key>StandardOutPath</key>
    <string>/Users/appium/jenkins/stdout.log</string>
    <key>StandardErrorPath</key>
    <string>/Users/appium/jenkins/error.log</string>
</dict>
</plist>
```

Finally set the owner, permissions, and then start the agent.

```
sudo chown root:wheel /Library/LaunchAgents/com.jenkins.ci.plist
sudo chmod 644 /Library/LaunchAgents/com.jenkins.ci.plist
launchctl load /Library/LaunchAgents/com.jenkins.ci.plist
launchctl start com.jenkins.ci
```

#### Clean up files (optional)

```
$HOME/Library/Logs/CoreSimulator/
/Library/Caches/com.apple.dt.instruments/
$HOME/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData/
```

All files in the above directory

### Android

#### maven Installation

```
brew install maven
```

#### More settings

1. download JDK
2. Download the Android SDK via Android Studio and set up the directory

macOS sets up the JavaHome and Android SDK directories and places the following code in `.bashrc` or `.zshrc` in the user directory

```
# the path of use Android Studio installation after 
# android sdk
export ANDROID_HOME=~/Library/Android/sdk
export PATH="$HOME/.yarn/bin:$PATH"
# java_home
export JAVA_HOME=$(/usr/libexec/java_home)
export PATH=$JAVA_HOME/bin:$PATH
export CLASS_PATH=$JAVA_HOME/lib
# adb...
export PATH=${PATH}:$ANDROID_HOME/tools:$ANDROID_HOME/platform-tools
export PATH=${PATH}:$ANDROID_HOME/tools/bin
```

At latest，You can use appium-doctor to check the configuration environment

```
appium-doctor
```

Write clearly in capabilities

- `platformVersion`
- `appPackage`
- `appActivity`
